### Hi there 👋
I'm Anh, a passionate web developer focusing on the frontend. I enjoy designing, writing code, and creating things that live on the internet.
My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, responsive design, and performant experiences.

- 🔭  I’m currently working on [Poncho.club](https://poncho.club) website.
- 📗  I'm planning to use [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/) for upcoming projects.
- 💻 Some of my projects: [Pomodoro Clock](https://anguyen0208.github.io/pomodoro-clock/), [Drum machine](https://anguyen0208.github.io/fcc-drum-machine/), [Financial Calculator](https://github.com/anguyen0208/Financial-Calculator-V2).
